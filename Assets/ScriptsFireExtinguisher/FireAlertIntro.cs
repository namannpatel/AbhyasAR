/// rather than automatically on scene load — showing it at Awake, before any scenario has
/// even been chosen, is how it used to always say "trash can" regardless of which of the
/// 4 scenarios actually got randomly placed. Purely narrative framing — it doesn't gate or
/// interact with the existing Stage-driven placement logic (ARPlacementController), which
/// already handles its own tap-by-tap sequencing independently.
